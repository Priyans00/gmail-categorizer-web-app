Project Title: Gmail Email Categorizer Web App

Objective:
Build a web application that connects to a Gmail account to fetch and categorize emails. The app should categorize emails based on user-defined rules or by leveraging simple machine learning techniques, providing an organized email view and an enhanced way to filter and manage incoming messages.

Project Requirements
Authentication & Authorization

Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google to securely access the userâ€™s Gmail account.
Use Google Cloud Console to manage API keys and permissions.
Backend Development

Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Flask, or Django) to manage API requests.
Implement routes to handle email fetching, categorization, and database storage.
Integrate the Gmail API to retrieve email metadata and content as needed.
Frontend Development

Design a user-friendly interface with HTML/CSS and a JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or plain JavaScript).
Display categorized emails in an organized format, with options to filter and search.
Implement UI components to show different categories of emails and add user controls to adjust categorization rules.
Email Categorization

Implement categorization based on:
Rules-Based Filtering: Allow users to set custom rules (e.g., based on sender, subject, or keywords).
Machine Learning (Optional): Integrate a basic ML model to automatically categorize emails based on patterns.
Provide options to apply, modify, or delete categorization rules.
Testing and Optimization

Test email fetching and categorization processes with sample data.
Optimize for performance and ensure secure handling of user data.
Deployment

Deploy on a cloud service (Google Cloud, AWS, or Heroku).
Configure environment variables to securely store API keys and database credentials.
Provide documentation for setting up and using the application.
Stretch Goals
Add a notifications feature for new emails in each category.
Create a dashboard with analytics showing email trends over time.
Implement an interactive tutorial for first-time users
